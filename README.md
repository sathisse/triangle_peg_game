### Authors:
This project is being developed cooperatively by members of the following meetup groups:
* [Tampa Bay Android Developers Group](https://www.meetup.com/Tampa-Bay-Android-Developers-Group/)
* [GDG SunCoast](https://www.meetup.com/GDGSUNCOAST/)

There are two versions of the game. The first is console Dart only and includes both a way to play the 
game and a recursive back-off method to solve the game. This can be done by running the appropriate 
configuration in the IDE or by entering `dart lib/triangle_peg_game.dart` on a terminal command line.

The second version is a basic Flutter GUI version. It can be run via the IDE in the usual way. 
Unfortunately, we found that since the game is squarish, is doesn't look very nice on typically shaped 
mobile screens. So we've abandoned it and have started working on one that will work better on all of
the platforms.

The next game is [Dots and Boxes](https://github.com/sathisse/dots_and_boxes).
