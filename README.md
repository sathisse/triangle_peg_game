Triangle Peg Game

### Authors:
This project is being developed cooperatively by members of the following meetup groups:
* [Tampa Bay Android Developers Group](https://www.meetup.com/Tampa-Bay-Android-Developers-Group/)
* [GDG SunCoast](https://www.meetup.com/GDGSUNCOAST/)
* GDG Capital Region

This initial version will be console Dart only and will include a way to play the game and a 
recursive back-off method to solve the game. We will next add a basic Flutter GUI version. If 
there is interest, we will later add various features such as sound, animation, ads, etc.

Run the file lib/triangle_peg_game.dart to execute the console version. This can be done via the IDE
or by entering 'dart lib/triangle_peg_game.dart' on a terminal command line.
